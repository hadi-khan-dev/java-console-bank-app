BankApp — Simple Java Banking Program

BankApp is a small Java console project I built to practice real-world programming skills.
It lets a user log in, check their balance, make deposits or withdrawals, and view a running history of all transactions made during the session.

I created this project to strengthen my understanding of Java basics, object-oriented programming, and clean code structure — the same skills I want to bring into a co-op role.

    🌟 What the App Can Do
    Log in with a username + password
    Greet the user personally
    Show the current balance
    Deposit and withdraw money
    Keep a full transaction log
    Run through a simple, easy-to-navigate menu
    Everything happens inside the console, making it a straightforward, beginner-friendly banking simulation.

🧩 How I Structured the Project
    bankapp/
    │
    ├── Main.java              // Starts the program
    ├── UserLogin.java         // Handles login + returns username
    ├── UserOptions.java       // Main menu and program flow
    └── UserTransactions.java  // Deposit, withdraw, and log history
I kept each responsibility in its own class so the code stays clean and organized — something I’ve been focusing on as I grow as a developer.d

▶️ How to Run It
    Put all files inside a folder called bankapp.
    Compile everything:
    javac bankapp/*.java
    Run the app:
    java bankapp.Main

🎯 Why I Built This Project
    This project helped me build confidence in:
    writing modular code
    handling user input
    managing program state
    designing small but functional features
    thinking like a developer, not just writing code

It’s one of the steps I’ve taken to prepare myself for real co-op work, and a reflection of the effort I’m putting into becoming a stronger programmer.
